# 🌏 KZ–KR Life Journey Analysis

A personal data-science project about adapting from Kazakhstan to South Korea (2019–2025)
Using Python, statistics, visualizations, and machine learning.
---
## 📌 Overview

 > "This project analyzes my emotional, social, and academic journey after moving from Kazakhstan to South Korea at age 17."

 Using self-recorded metrics (stress, happiness, Korean level, belonging, friends, sleep, etc.), I explore:
 - 📊 Life trends over 7 years (2019–2025)
 - 💙 Emotional adaptation between two countries
 - 👥 Social changes after immigration
 - 🧠 Stress vs Happiness dynamics
 - 🤖 A machine learning model predicting my happiness
 - 🇰🇿 Nostalgia for Kazakhstan
 - 🇰🇷 Growing sense of belonging in Korea

This project is both a technical assignment and a personal reflection of living abroad.

## 📊 1. Key Visualizations

**🇰🇷 Korean Level Growth**

Shows language improvement from 0 → TOPIK 5.


**😰 Stress vs 😊 Happiness**

Clear cycles of burnout and recovery, especially during adaptation years.


**👫 Friends Count Over Years**

Social circle shrinking after immigration and slowly rebuilding.


**😴 Sleep Quality**

Sleep patterns becoming unstable in university years.


**💙 Emotional Transition (KZ → KR)**

Strong nostalgia during early years, rising belonging in later years.


**🤖 2. Machine Learning Model**

A Linear Regression model predicts my happiness using:
 - stress
 - friends_count
 - sleep_quality
 - korean_level
 - nostalgia_kz
 - belonging_kr
   
---   

## 📈 Coefficients

 ### Feature Effect
 - **Stress** –6.02
 - **Friends count** –4.06
 - **Sleep quality** –0.21
 - **Korean level** –8.42
 - **Nostalgia for Kazakhstan** +0.76
 - **Belonging to Korea** +2.80

## 🔍 Interpretation
 - Stress significantly lowers happiness
 - Korean level has a negative coefficient because the hardest years (2022–2023) were also years of intense study
 - More belonging in Korea strongly increases happiness
 - Nostalgia for Kazakhstan has a small positive effect
 - Number of friends does not correlate positively with happiness

## 📉 Model Accuracy

The model predicts happiness perfectly on this dataset:

## 🧠 3. Insights
 - My emotional wellbeing depends more on identity and belonging than on social or academic metrics.
 - Immigration years (2022–2023) were stressful but transformative.
 - Happiness grows when Korea starts to feel like “home”.
 - Burnout periods match intense study phases (language courses, university).
 - Sleep has surprisingly weak correlation to happiness compared to stress and belonging.

## 🔧 4. How to Run This Project
```
 pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

Run the notebook:
```
01_data_exploration.ipynb
```
Or open directly in Google Colab.

## 📝 5. Future Improvements
 - Add more years of data
 - Add photos visualization timeline
 - Use more advanced ML models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
 - Build a small web dashboard with Streamlit
 - Add sentiment analysis of journal entries
